                      it in short answer format early for bonus points, or wait for multiple choice
                      answers to pop up, encouraging smart risk-taking. All question sets are user created,
                      meaning they can very greatly in topic, focus, difficulty, and length.

                    <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--col3">Good question! There are many reasons to pick Whizdom over any alternatives.
                      For starters, it can be used offline in your browser. It sounds unbelievable, but after the first time visiting whizdom.io,

                        Whizdom is played entirely on the participants’ own computers, meaning that there
                        is no need for a projector/television. Yet another reason to pick Whizdom is the option to add
                        explanations for why answers are right or wrong, adding another layer of depth and allowing students
                        to quickly learn, study, and retain knowledge. Finally, the ability to quickly and easily collaborate with
                         teachers and friends on making question sets is hugely important, as it allows everybody to contribute and
                          makes life easier for the maker of the set. All in all, Whizdom’s perfect combination of simplicity and features
                           makes it the ultimate choice for a quiz game in any situation and environment, be it friendly or competitive!

                       and designed by three American high schoolers as part of the PennApps XV Hackathon.
                        In several of their classes, they used competitive quiz games to study for tests,
                         review in class, run a school club, and practice for academic quiz tournaments.
                          However, these quiz services often lacked variation, did not reward speed and accuracy enough,
                          and had game-breaking glitches. Whizdom is the culmination of their efforts
                           to solve these problems and create the ultimate quiz game.
